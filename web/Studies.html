       <h3>GROWTH AND VOLATILITY OF  MICROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS IN THE U.S. </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify">A micropolitan statistical area is defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as “A core based statistical area associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000.” Recently, the U.S. Census Bureau also identified the micropolitan area as an “emerging metropolitan area.” Despite its growing importance, the literature on the economic characteristics of micropolitan areas so far has been limited. The objectives of this study are: (1) to describe the geographic distribution, growth, and volatility of the U.S. micropolitan areas during the 1969-2012 period; and (2) to identify and measure the determinants of growth and volatility of micropolitan areas. Findings show that micropolitan area growth is dependent on sectoral composition, initial market size, and spatial/locational effects.

       <h3>Industrial Composition, Local Fiscal Policy and Micropolitan Area Economic Growth </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify">Various studies have analyzed the impact of economic policy, especially fiscal policy, on the economic growth of regional and local area economies. A general finding is that industrial composition has been a consistently important determinant of local economic growth as well as of regional differences in the effects of economic policy (Moore and Walkes (2010), Gabe (2003)). The influence of fiscal policy variables has been ambiguous depending, for example, on the measure of economic growth used – employment, population, firm growth, etc. This current study adds to the literature by analyzing the U.S. micropolitan areas (with populations between 10,000 and 50,000) following Davidsson and Rickman (2011). It finds that local and state fiscal policies, industrial composition, distance, and human capital have significant impacts on personal income growth in micropolitan areas.

       <h3>The Role of the Housing Supply and the Regulatory  Environment in Economic Growth of Micropolitan  Statistical Areas </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify">The purpose of this study is to identify and measure the impact of various factors that affect the economic performance of micropolitan statistical areas in the U.S.  Specifically, it is hypothesized that micropolitan area economic growth is highly related to locational amenities, primarily the housing supply and the regulatory environment.  The Glaeser and Tobio (2008) growth model is used to obtain estimates for the amenity growth effect, productivity growth effect, and the housing supply growth effect for a cross-section of micropolitan statistical areas for the 1990-2010 period.  A proxy variable for the regulatory environment is also developed.  The findings indicate that a flexible housing supply and regulatory environment are significant determinants of the growth of micropolitan areas during the period under study.

       <h3>U.S. Micropolitan Area Growth:  A Spatial Equilibrium Growth Analysis  </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify">Because U.S. micropolitan areas have only relatively recently been awarded official status, little is known about their comparative economic performance. Yet, since their inception economic performance among micropolitan areas has received considerable attention from the public and local area policymakers. This paper examines micropolitan area growth during the 1990s, a period of strong national growth. A spatial equilibrium growth framework and estimated reduced-form regressions containing an extensive number of variables are used to assess the sources of differentials in micropolitan area growth.  Overall, differences in productivity growth appeared to primarily underlie micropolitan area growth differentials, though household amenities and the elasticity of housing supply also appeared to be nearly as important.
